This is a small step yet important in learning NLP, to get familiar with using the pre-trained model which is based on transformers.

Main aim of this work: 
1. Following the tutorial of the provided youtube video, I am practicing on how to perform webscraping and using the crawled data for sentiment analysis.
2. Understand the process of applying a pre-trained model in NLP task.
3. Finally, visualise the ratings.
